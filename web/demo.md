Perfect Prajju 👍 You asked the right way. Let’s slow down and **unpack every symbol and formula** like building blocks.

We want to understand this:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
$$

This is the **prediction line**. But how do we actually find the values of $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ from data? That’s where math comes in.

## STEP 1: Understanding the Data

Imagine a dataset:

| Hours studied (x) | Marks (y) |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| 1                 | 20        |
| 2                 | 30        |
| 3                 | 50        |
| 4                 | 60        |

Here:

* $x$ = input (hours)
* $y$ = actual output (marks)
* $h_\theta(x)$ = predicted output (marks by our line)

We want to make a line that goes **as close as possible** to all points.

## STEP 2: The Formula for Slope ($\theta_1$)

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Let’s break this monster:

* $x_i$: each x value (like 1, 2, 3, 4)
* $y_i$: each y value (like 20, 30, 50, 60)
* $\bar{x}$: the mean (average) of all x values
* $\bar{y}$: the mean (average) of all y values
* $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$: tells us how x and y move together
* $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$: tells us how x spreads out

👉 This fraction basically measures:
**“How much y changes when x changes.”** That’s our slope.

## STEP 3: The Formula for Intercept ($\theta_0$)

$$
\theta_0 = \bar{y} - \theta_1 \bar{x}
$$

Here:

* Take average of y ($\bar{y}$)
* Subtract slope × average of x
* This gives the starting point of the line (when x = 0).

👉 This makes sure the line balances around the middle of the data.

## STEP 4: Example Calculation

Let’s do it for the dataset:

x = \[1, 2, 3, 4]
y = \[20, 30, 50, 60]

1. $\bar{x} = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5$
2. $\bar{y} = (20+30+50+60)/4 = 40$

Now slope formula:

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{(1-2.5)(20-40) + (2-2.5)(30-40) + (3-2.5)(50-40) + (4-2.5)(60-40)}{(1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2}
$$

Do step by step:

* (1-2.5)(20-40) = (-1.5)(-20) = 30
* (2-2.5)(30-40) = (-0.5)(-10) = 5
* (3-2.5)(50-40) = (0.5)(10) = 5
* (4-2.5)(60-40) = (1.5)(20) = 30
  → Sum = 70

Denominator:

* (1-2.5)^2 = 2.25
* (2-2.5)^2 = 0.25
* (3-2.5)^2 = 0.25
* (4-2.5)^2 = 2.25
  → Sum = 5

So:

$$
\theta_1 = 70 / 5 = 14
$$

Now intercept:

$$
\theta_0 = 40 - (14)(2.5) = 40 - 35 = 5
$$

---

## Final Line

$$
h(x) = 5 + 14x
$$

👉 Meaning:

* If you don’t study (x=0), you’ll still score 5.
* For every 1 hour of study, your marks go up by 14.

✅ This is **how we calculate by hand**. For bigger datasets, the same formula works, just more adding and subtracting.

Do you want me to **make a very simple table** showing each step (like x, y, x−x̄, y−ȳ, (x−x̄)(y−ȳ), etc.) so you can *see it clearly* instead of this block of formulas?
