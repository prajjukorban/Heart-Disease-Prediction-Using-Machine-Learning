# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health-related parameters, the model helps in early diagnosis, enabling timely medical intervention.

## 📖 Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Machine learning can help predict heart disease risk by analyzing patient data, improving early diagnosis and treatment. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify individuals based on heart disease risk.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Multiple machine learning models for classification
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Interactive web app (optional, if using Flask/Streamlit)

   cd heart-disease-prediction


## 📊 Model Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using various metrics:

### ✅ Metrics Used:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision**: Indicates how many predicted positive cases are actually positive.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the ability to detect positive cases.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced evaluation.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of model predictions vs. actual values.
- **ROC Curve & AUC Score**: Evaluates classification performance at different thresholds.

The **Random Forest model** performed the best in terms of accuracy and overall performance.

### 🛠️ Hyperparameter Tuning:
GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV are used for optimizing model hyperparameters, improving prediction accuracy.
